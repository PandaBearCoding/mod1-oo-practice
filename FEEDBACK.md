# Part One - Intro to OO
Classes look good! I was glad to see the additions you made of the examples in comments and the additional methods. We'll get into creating more methods in the rest of the week and it's good to practice thinking of method you'd want in your classes and creating them on your own. Feel free to go beyond the listed deliverables! 

# Part 2 

Nice! well done! it is clear to me you understand the diffrence between a class and instance method which is awesome! I like that you went above and made some other methods.
